ResNet Model for classification task
Classification is nothing but predicting which class an item belongs to. Some classifiers could be binary(Spam/no Spam, Defect/No defect) while others are multi-class. Classification is a very common use case of deep learning where classification algorithms are used to solve problems like email spam filtering, document categorization, speech recognition, image recognition, biomdeical usage and handwriting recognition.

Classification network could be developed in many ways using different neural network or ML algorithms but the one that I propose is based on ResNet Network. This is a very generic code and could be implemented for any classification task if you have your own dataset and the number of classes to be detected is known. I hope this helps many student/developers develop different classification models for various applications. This does not use any pre-defined model or transfer learning hence, could be used for any classification task from scratch.




This is my first public repository!
Do give feedback if any :)
